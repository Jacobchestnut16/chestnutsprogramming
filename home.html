        I graduated from Avonworth High school, and moved on to the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford for secondary
        education in Computer Sciences.

        I have always had a passion for both math and art, so my dream after college is to begin back-and-front-end
        development. Back-end is where all the mathy like coding happens, such as how apps hold memory of your profile
        for logins, or score for games. Front-end is where you make the app look pretty, but in my case I do not like
        most app development. Instead, I dream to be the next Steve Jobs creating my own computer operating system.

        As a student I wish to help small local businesses - with my background in HTML, JavaScript, & CSS - by
        designing and publishing websites. I am qualified in low levels of CyberSecurity; therefore, I am able to setup
        protection policies and procedures to ensure your website is protected from most threats. I am also great at
        creating high SEO scores, which is how websites get to the top of the page during google searches. I even run my
        emailing services for websites to ensure satisfaction with contact pages.
